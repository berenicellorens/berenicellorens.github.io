Biography

Berenice Llorens is a composer, guitarist, DJ, and experimental sound artist from Córdoba, Argentina, currently based in Berlin. In her practice, Llorens collects and reinterprets sounds from nature, the city, and machines, exploring the relationship between humans, technology, and the environment to reflect on how we listen to, perceive, and transform the spaces we inhabit. Through the use of loops and delays as tools for reconfiguring memory, she turns space into experimental territories where sounds create and reshape new sonic ecosystems. Her work moves from the human and earthly pulse to electroacoustic textures, fractured techno, and experimental soundscapes, integrating field recordings, extended guitar techniques, pedals, and synthesizers.

Early in her career, she studied piano at the Conservatorio Provincial de Córdoba, Musical Composition at the Facultad Nacional de las Artes de Córdoba (AR), and Graphic Design at Aguas de la Cañada. She continues to train independently, both inside and outside academic structures, in the fields of sound art research, post-natural studies, AI, computer music, sound spatialization, and technologies focused on programming and audio post-production.

Her multidisciplinary work combines compositions, performances, audiovisual pieces, writings, and drawings. Llorens expands her solo practice through collaborations with artists in music, literature, dance, and film, and she also explores curating and producing radio shows and radio art. For 15 years, she collaborated as a multi-instrumentalist in various popular music bands from the Córdoba scene, and she is co-founder of projects such as Marmotas Dreams and Toros.

n 2021, she was recognized as an experimental sound artist by the National Institute of Music (INAMU) and received the Creation Grant from the National Fund for the Arts (FNA). She was part of the Amplify DAI network, supported by the British Council. Her solo and collaborative work has been presented at major international festivals and cultural spaces such as Mutek (CA), Mutek (AR), ArtLab (AR), Oi Futuro (BR), Humboldt Forum (GE), Earth Day Arts Model (USA), Now Net Arts (USA), Centro de Arte Sonoro (AR), Museo Sívori (AR), LPM (GE), Morphine Raum (GE), and Acud Macht Neu (GE), among others.
