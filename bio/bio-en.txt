Biography

Berenice Llorens is a composer, guitarist, and experimental artist from Córdoba, Argentina, currently based in Berlin.

The central focus of her artistic exploration lies in observing human beings and their environment, investigating how we listen to, perceive, and modify our habitat. By capturing and reinterpreting field recordings, mainly from native forests and more polluted urban soundscapes, Llorens creates evolving sonic ecosystems. She transforms space into a stage where sound material flows and continuously shifts through fluctuating loops. Her compositions and improvisations invite conscious listening, an exercise of bringing the outside in and the inside out, provoking deep reflection on our relationship with the surrounding environment. Oscillating between broken and lively pulses, her pieces integrate electroacoustic textures, improvisation, post-rock ideas, and techno, creating experimental atmospheres in real time.

Her multidisciplinary work blends compositions, performances, audiovisual art, writings, drawings, and collaborations with ensembles and dance. Additionally, she ventures into curating and producing radio programs, as well as researching artificial intelligence, computer music, and sound specialization.

For 15 years, she collaborated as a multi-instrumentalist in various popular music bands from the Córdoba scene, and is a part of projects like Marmotas Dreams and Toros. In 2021, she was recognized as an experimental sound artist by the National Institute of Music (INAMU) and received the Creation Grant from the National Fund for the Arts (FNA)

Her solo and collaborative work has been presented at major international events and cultural venues, such as Mutek (CA), Mutek (AR), ArtLab (AR), Oi Futuro (BR), Earth Day Arts Model (USA), Now Net Arts (USA), CAso (AR), Museo Sívori (AR), LPM 2023 (GE), Morphine Raum (GE), and Acud Macht Neu (GE), among others.
