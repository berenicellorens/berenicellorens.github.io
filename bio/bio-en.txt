Biography

Berenice Llorens is a composer, guitarist, and experimental DJ born in Córdoba, Argentina, currently based in Berlin.

Her multidisciplinary work spans a wide range of artistic expressions, including original compositions, albums, live performances, audiovisual art, writings, drawings, and collaborations in ensembles and dance. Llorens is venturing into curating and producing radio art, as well as conducting research in the field of artificial intelligence and multichannel audio.

At the core of her artistic exploration lies the observation of human beings and their environment, where the artist investigates how we listen to and perceive our surroundings and how this transforms our way of reproducing and creating sounds. The enveloping sonic atmospheres and the variation of her soundscapes, through the capture and reinterpretation of sounds from nature, the city, and machines, become an exercise of bringing the outside in and the inside out. She navigates with flexibility through genres such as experimental, contrasting the rhythms of techno with fragmented pulsations and deconstructed rhythms resonating with the sonic textures inherent in electroacoustic music. Each piece is a unique experience that aims to engage the listener and challenge their musical expectations.

With university training in Music Composition, piano, and studies in audio production and post-production, Berenice also has a solid 15-year experience as a multi-instrumentalist in various popular music bands in the Córdoba scene. In 2021, she was recognized as an experimental sound artist by the National Institute of Music (INAMU) and awarded the Creation Grant from the Fondo Nacional de las Artes (FNA). In 2022, she participated in Artlab Artistic Residencies program by Amplify D.A.I. in collaboration with the British Council, making together with the brazilian artist Carol Santana an audiovisual piece entitled "Portal del Sur". In 2022 she produced and curates the radio show "Amplify Radio x Rea" which was broadcasted on Radio Electrónica Argentina. Currently, she is developing Beyond of line, a radio program with a focus on experimental music and sound art broadcasting every month on Refuge Worldwide Berlin.
