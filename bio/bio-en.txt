Biography

Berenice Llorens is a composer, guitarist, and experimental artist from Córdoba, Argentina, currently based in Berlin.

At the core of her artistic exploration lies the observation of human beings and their environment, investigating how we listen to and perceive our surroundings, and how this transforms the creative and compositional processes. By recording and reinterpreting sounds from nature, the city, and machines, Llorens creates evolving sonic ecosystems, transforming space into a stage where sound material flows and continuously modifies through fluctuating loops. Her compositions and improvisations invite a conscious listening experience, an exercise of bringing the outside in and the inside out, provoking deep reflection on our relationship with the environment.

Her multidisciplinary work blends compositions, performances, audiovisual art, writings, drawings, and collaborations with ensembles and dance. Additionally, she ventures into curating and producing radio programs, as well as researching artificial intelligence, computer music, and sound specialization.

She studied Musical Composition at the National University of Córdoba and piano at the Provincial Conservatory, complementing her training with studies in audio production and post-production, synthesis, and sound art. For 15 years, she collaborated as a multi-instrumentalist in various popular music bands from the Córdoba scene, and is a part of projects like Marmotas Dreams and Toros. In 2021, she was recognized as an experimental sound artist by the National Institute of Music (INAMU) and received the Creation Grant from the National Fund for the Arts (FNA)

Her solo and collaborative work has been presented at major international events and cultural venues, such as Mutek (CA), Mutek (AR), ArtLab (AR), Oi Futuro (BR), Earth Day Arts Model (USA), Now Net Arts (USA), CAso (AR), Museo Sívori (AR), LPM 2023 (GE), Morphine Raum (GE), and Acud Macht Neu (GE), among others.
