Biography

Berenice Llorens is a composer, guitarist, and experimental artist from Córdoba, Argentina, currently based in Berlin.

In her practice, Llorens collects and reinterprets sounds from nature, the city, and machines, exploring the relationship between humans, machines, and the environment to reflect on how we listen to, perceive, and alter them. Through the use of loops and delays as tools for reconfiguring memory, she turns space into her own territory, where sounds create and transform new sonic ecosystems. Through field recordings, extended guitar techniques, pedals, and synthesizers, her work moves from the human and earthly pulse to electroacoustic textures, fractured techno, and experimental soundscapes.

Her multidisciplinary work blends compositions, performances, audiovisual art, writings, drawings, and collaborations with ensembles and dance. She ventures into curating and producing radio programs, radio art as well as researching artificial intelligence, computer music, and sound spatialization.

For 15 years, she collaborated as a multi-instrumentalist in various popular music bands from the Córdoba scene, and She is a co-founder of projects like Marmotas Dreams and Toros. In 2021, she was recognized as an experimental sound artist by the National Institute of Music (INAMU) and received the Creation Grant from the National Fund for the Arts (FNA). She was part of the Amplify DAI network, supported by the British Council.

Her solo and collaborative work has been presented at major international events and cultural venues, such as Mutek (CA), Mutek (AR), ArtLab (AR), Oi Futuro (BR), Earth Day Arts Model (USA), Now Net Arts (USA), Centro de Arte Sonoro (AR), Museo Sívori (AR), LPM 2023 (GE), Morphine Raum (GE), and Acud Macht Neu (GE), among others.
