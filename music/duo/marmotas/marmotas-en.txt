Marmotas Dreams is a sound experimentation duo composed of Berenice Llorens and Constanza Pellicci, active since 2017. Through improvisational performances in various spaces and festivals both nationally and internationally, the duo explores the creative possibilities of experimental music. Their approach blends conventional structures with free and ever-evolving compositions, fostering a dialogue between genres and aesthetics. Their work challenges the boundaries of popular song, proposing new sonic narratives.

In 2020, during the pandemic, Voyage emerged as a sonic and performative project that responded to social isolation with a creative proposal: imagining journeys to various cultural destinations and geographical landscapes. In this context, the duo composes pieces inspired by literary and cultural references. Pequeño Kimono, the first destination, explores the phonetics of Japanese haikus in dialogue with oriental sonic atmospheres. Leaving Leaves, their second destination, is based on excerpts from Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, investigating new narrative and compositional forms oscillating between verse and free song, integrating voices, analog synthesizers, and electronic and acoustic processes.
