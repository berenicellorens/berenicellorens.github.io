SoBery Nice is an electronic music duo formed by Berenice Llorens and Sof√≠a Piuzzi.

The project began to take shape in 2019, when both, in addition to their solo projects and after sharing several DJ booths doing B2B, decide to consolidate a duo, seeking to prevail with a fun touch the variety and mix of different genres; techno, minimal, house, indie dance.

Both Sofia and Berenice come from instrumental music, alternative rock and experimentation, so the initiative arose to start incorporating their own productions, synthesizers and instruments, thus generating a hybrid between dj set and live set.
