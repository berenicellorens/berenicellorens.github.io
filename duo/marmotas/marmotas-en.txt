Marmotas dreams is a duo of improvisation and experimentation formed by Berenice Llorens (electric guitar, synthesizers and electronic processes) and Constanza Pellicci (voice and performance).

Since 2018 the duo performs concerts and performances. In 2020 they record their first album "Peque√±o kimono" with which they start a compositional project called Voyage. This project proposes to explore ways to travel through sounds through different geographical landscapes, experimenting with different languages, phonetics and sonorities.
